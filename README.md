# Two-stream instability and electron hole analysis 1D

This code can simulate electron phase space coherent structures known as ”electron holes” which are formedat the non-linear evolution stage of a two-stream instability plasma simulation.  

This instabilityis  generated  during  the  evolution  of  two  counter  streaming  electrons  moving  in  one  dimensionin  the  presence  of  a  background  of  neutralizing  static  positive  charges.  

We  show  the  temporalevolution of the electrons phase space, the associated electrostatic potential and electrostatic fieldand the evolution of the velocity distribution function.  We find numerically the energy contoursand velocity distribution function corresponding to different sections of the electrons phase space "hole".  We explain the numerical code implementation and the physical phenomena in "**Tutorial for the solution of a plasma electrostatic one dimensionalmodel using a PIC scheme**" We expect this work to be a useful tool for students interested in plasma physics research.
